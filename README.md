# SOC Triage Lab
A hands-on lab focused on manual SOC Level 1 alert analysis.

## The goal of this project is simple:
- review realistic security alerts,
- extract key indicators,
- decide: False Positive / True Positive / Escalate,
- document the reasoning.

## This repository contains:
- alerts/ - synthetic alert samples (JSON)
- reports/ - my triage decisions (Markdown)
- notebooks/ - optional Jupyter notebook for structured analysis
- docs/ - methodology & notes

## Why this project exists:
- SOC work is 70% triage + decision-making, not tools.
- This lab shows *how I thonk*, not just what I studied.
- It serves as a practical portfolio for SOC roles.

## Planned alert scenarios include:
- SSH brute force
- Cloud sign-in anomalies
- Suspicious PowerShell activity
- Phishing indicators
- EDR suspicious behavior
